"After the download, a ``teamengine_wms_130.qgs`` project is available in "
"the new ``data`` directory. This project has to be registered as the "
"default project for QGIS Server thanks to the "
"**QGIS_SERVER_PROJECT_FILE** environment variable. This way, we don't "
"need to explicitly set the ``MAP`` vendor-parameter of QGIS Server."

"A specific configuration is also necessary to comply with metadata tests."
" Indeed, some metadata are available in the ``data/metadata`` directory "
"and have to be available for the OGC testing framework thanks to an URL. "
"The easiest option is to configure your web server to have an access "
"through something like ``http://XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/metadata/Autos.xml``. "
"These metadata URLs are defined in the project and inserted in the WMS "
"``GetCapabilities`` document. So the project needs to be updated "
"according to your testing environment to let QGIS Server generate a valid"
" XML document:"
