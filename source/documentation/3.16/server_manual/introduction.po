"Features 1.0 (WFS3) and WCS 1.1.1 implementation that, in addition, "
"implements advanced cartographic features for thematic mapping. QGIS "
"Server is a FastCGI/CGI (Common Gateway Interface) application written in"

"QGIS Server uses QGIS as back end for the GIS logic and for map "
"rendering. Furthermore, the Qt library is used for graphics and for "
"platform-independent C++ programming. In contrast to other WMS software, "
"the QGIS Server uses cartographic rules as a configuration language, both"
" for the server configuration and for the user-defined cartographic "
"rules."
