"Many times it is useful for a plugin to save some variables so that the "

"run."

"These variables can be saved and retrieved with help of Qt and QGIS API. "
"For each variable, you should pick a key that will be used to access the "
"variable --- for user's favourite color you could use key "
"\"favourite_color\" or any other meaningful string. It is recommended to "
"give some structure to naming of keys."

"**global settings** --- they are bound to the user at a particular "
"machine. QGIS itself stores a lot of global settings, for example, main "
"window size or default snapping tolerance. Settings are handled using the"
" :class:`QgsSettings <qgis.core.QgsSettings>` class, through for example "
"the :meth:`setValue() <qgis.core.QgsSettings.setValue>` and "
":meth:`value() <qgis.core.QgsSettings.value>` methods."

"**project settings** --- vary between different projects and therefore "
"they are connected with a project file. Map canvas background color or "
"destination coordinate reference system (CRS) are examples --- white "
"background and WGS84 might be suitable for one project, while yellow "
"background and UTM projection are better for another one."

"As you can see, the :meth:`writeEntry() "
"<qgis.core.QgsProject.writeEntry>` method is used for many data types "
"(integer, string, list), but several methods exist for reading the "
"setting value back, and the corresponding one has to be selected for each"
" data type."

"**map layer settings** --- these settings are related to a particular "
"instance of a map layer with a project. They are *not* connected with "
"underlying data source of a layer, so if you create two map layer "
"instances of one shapefile, they will not share the settings. The "
"settings are stored inside the project file, so if the user opens the "
"project again, the layer-related settings will be there again. The value "
"for a given setting is retrieved using the :meth:`customProperty() "
"<qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.customProperty>` method, and can be set using the "
":meth:`setCustomProperty() <qgis.core.QgsMapLayer.setCustomProperty>` "
"one."
