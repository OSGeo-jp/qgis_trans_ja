"In a GCS, you are working on this sphere, but your screen is flat. When "
"you try to represent the sphere on a flat surface, distortion occurs, "
"similar to what would happen if you cut open a tennis ball and tried to "

" equally far apart from each other, even at the poles (where they are "
"supposed to meet). This means that, as you travel away from the equator "
"on your map, the scale of the objects that you see gets larger and "
