"In this lesson we will see how processing algorithms handle selections in"
" vector layers that are used as inputs, and how to create a selection "
"using a particular type of algorithm."

"Unlike other analysis plugins in QGIS, you will not find in processing "
"geoalgorithms any \"Use only selected features\" checkbox or similar. The"
" behaviour regarding selection is set for the whole plugin and all its "
"algorithms, and not for each algorithm execution. Algorithms follow the "
"following simple rules when using a vector layer."

"You can test that yourself by selecting a few points in any of the layers"
" that we used in the last chapter, and running the reprojection algorithm"
" on them. The reprojected layer that you will obtain will contain only "
"those points that were selected, unless there was no selection, which "
"will cause the resulting layer to contain all points from the original "
"layer."

"To make a selection, you can use any of the available methods and tools "
"in QGIS. However, you can also use a geoalgorithm to do so. Algorithms "
"for creating a selection are found in the toolbox under "
"*Vector/Selection*"

"You will notice that this algorithm does not produce any output, but "
"modifies the input layer (not the layer itself, but its selection). This "
"is an uncommon behaviour, since all the other algorithms will produce new"
" layers and not alter the input layers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/selection.rst:29
msgid ""
"Since the selection is not part of the data itself, but something that "
"only exist within QGIS, these selection algorithms only must be used "
"selecting a layer that is open in QGIS, and not with the file selection "
"option that you can find in the corresponding parameter value box."

msgid ""
"The selection we have just made, like most of the ones created by the "
"rest of the selection algorithms, can also be done manually from QGIS, so"
" you might be wondering what is the point on using an algorithm for that."
" Although now this might not make much sense to you, we will later see "
"how to create models and scripts. If you want to make a selection in the "
"middle of a model (which defines a processing workflow), only a "
"geoalgorithm can be added to a model, and other QGIS elements and "
"operations cannot be added. That is the reason why some processing "
"algorithms duplicate functionality that is also available in other QGIS "
"elements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/selection.rst:33
msgid ""
"By now, just remember that selections can be made using processing "
"geoalgorithms, and that algorithms will only use the selected features if"
" a selection exists, or all features otherwise."
