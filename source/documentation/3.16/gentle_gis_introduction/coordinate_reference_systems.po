"which it will be used. For example, a projection may have unacceptable "
"distortions if used to map the entire African continent, but may be an "
"excellent choice for a **large-scale (detailed) map** of your country. "
"The properties of a map projection may also influence some of the design "

"If your goal in projecting a map is to accurately measure distances, you "

"When a map portrays areas over the entire map, so that all mapped areas "

"calculations of area are the dominant calculations you will perform. If, "

"projections are the best choice. On the one hand, the larger the area you"

"having their angles distorted when you use an equal area projection. "
