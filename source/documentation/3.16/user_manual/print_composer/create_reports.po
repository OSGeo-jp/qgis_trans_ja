"By definition, a GIS report is a document containing information "

":guilabel:`Populated Places` layer has an attribute with the same name as"
" the defining field in the parent layer, :guilabel:`adm1name`, tagging "
"each place with the state it is contained within (if you’re lucky your "

"Attributes by Location <qgisjoinattributesbylocation>` Processing "

#: ../../docs/user_manual/print_composer/create_reports.rst:231
msgid ""
"Here we created a basic body for the Populated Places group, including a "

" their populated places, and finally the report footer. If we were to add"

"In addition to nested subsections, subsections in a report can also be "
