":guilabel:`Prefer output filename for layer names`. The name of each "
"resulting layer created by an algorithm is defined by the algorithm "
"itself. In some cases, a fixed name might be used, meaning that the same "
"output name will be used, no matter which input layer is used. In other "
"cases, the name might depend on the name of the input layer or some of "
"the parameters used to run the algorithm. If this checkbox is checked, "
"the name will be taken from the output filename instead. Notice that, if "
"the output is saved to a temporary file, the filename of this temporary "
"file is usually a long and meaningless one intended to avoid collision "
"with other already existing filenames."

"the style you want using QGIS, save it to a file, and then enter the path"
" to that file in the settings so the algorithms can use it. Whenever a "
"layer is loaded by Processing and added to the QGIS canvas, it will be "
