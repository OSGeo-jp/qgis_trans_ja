"One of the most common resource connections is via HTTP(S), e.g. web "
"mapping servers, and authentication method plugins often work for these "
"types of connections. Method plugins have access to the HTTP request "
"object and can manipulate both the request as well as its headers. This "
"allows for many forms of internet-based authentication. When connecting "
"via HTTP(S) using the standard username/password authentication method "
"will attempt HTTP BASIC authentication upon connection."
