"This authentication database can be moved between QGIS installations "

"completely separate from normal QGIS settings. A configuration ID (a "
"random 7-character alphanumeric string) is generated when initially "
"storing a configuration to the database. This represents the "
"configuration, thereby allowing the ID to be stored in plain text "
"application components, (such as project, plugin, or settings files) "

"password. The password is then cached for the remainder of the session "
"(until application is quit), unless the user manually chooses an action "
"to clear its cached value. Some instances of using the authentication "
