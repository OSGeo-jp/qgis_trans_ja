"Now that you've got a map, you need to be able to print it or to export "
"it to a document. The reason is, a GIS map file is not an image. Rather, "
"it saves the state of the GIS program, with references to all the layers,"
" their labels,colors, etc. So for someone who doesn't have the data or "
"the same GIS program (such as QGIS), the map file will be useless. "
"Luckily, QGIS can export its map file to a format that anyone's computer "
"can read, as well as printing out the map if you have a printer "
"connected. Both exporting and printing is handled via the *Print Layout*."
