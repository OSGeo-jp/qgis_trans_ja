"Converting between raster and vector formats allows you to make use of "
"both raster and vector data when solving a GIS problem, as well as using "
"the various analysis methods unique to these two forms of geographic "
"data. This increases the flexibility you have when considering data "
"sources and processing methods for solving a GIS problem."
