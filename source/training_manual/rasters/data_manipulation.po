"Raster data is quite different from vector data. Vector data has discrete"
" features with geometries constructed out of vertices, and perhaps "
"connected with lines and/or areas. Raster data, however, is like any "
"image. Although it may portray various properties of objects in the real "
"world, these objects don't exist as separate objects. Rather, they are "
"represented using pixels with different values."

"Luckily, QGIS allows you to do exactly this, and without needing to "

"The above methods allow you to virtually merge datasets using a catalog, "
