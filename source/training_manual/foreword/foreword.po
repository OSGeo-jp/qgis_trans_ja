"Welcome to our course! We will be showing you how to use QGIS easily and "
"efficiently. If you are new to GIS, we will tell you what you need to get"
" started. If you are an experienced user, you will see how QGIS fulfills "
"all the functions you expect from a GIS program, and more!"

"As information becomes increasingly spatially aware, there is no shortage"
" of tools able to fulfill some or all commonly used GIS functions. Why "
"should anyone be using QGIS over some other GIS software package?"

msgid "Here are only some of the reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/foreword/foreword.rst:17
msgid ""
"*It's free, as in lunch.* Installing and using the QGIS program costs you"
" a grand total of zero money. No initial fee, no recurring fee, nothing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/foreword/foreword.rst:20
msgid ""
"*It's free, as in liberty.* If you need extra functionality in QGIS, you "
"can do more than just hope it will be included in the next release. You "
"can sponsor the development of a feature, or add it yourself if you are "
"familiar with programming."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/foreword/foreword.rst:25
msgid ""
"*It's constantly developing.* Because anyone can add new features and "
"improve on existing ones, QGIS never stagnates. The development of a new "
"tool can happen as quickly as you need it to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/foreword/foreword.rst:29
msgid ""
"*Extensive help and documentation is available.* If you're stuck with "
"anything, you can turn to the extensive documentation, your fellow QGIS "
"users, or even the developers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/foreword/foreword.rst:33
msgid "*Cross-platform.* QGIS can be installed on MacOS, Windows and Linux."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/foreword/foreword.rst:40
msgid ""
"In 2008 we launched the :ref:`Gentle Introduction to GIS "
"<gentle_introduction_gis>`, a completely free, open content resource for "
"people who want to learn about GIS without being overloaded with jargon "
"and new terminology. It was sponsored by the South African government and"
" has been a phenomenal success, with people all over the world writing to"
" us to tell us how they are using the materials to run University "
"Training Courses, teach themselves GIS and so on. The Gentle Introduction"
" is not a software tutorial, but rather aims to be a generic text "
"(although we used QGIS in all examples) for someone learning about GIS. "
"There is also the QGIS manual which provides a detailed functional "
"overview of the QGIS application. However, it is not structured as a "
"tutorial, but rather as a reference guide. At Linfiniti Consulting CC. we"
" frequently run training courses and have realised that a third resource "
"is needed - one that leads the reader sequentially through learning the "
"key aspects of QGIS in a trainer-trainee format - which prompted us to "
"produce this work."

"This training manual is intended to provide all the materials needed to "
"run a 5 day course on QGIS, PostgreSQL and PostGIS. The course is "
"structured with content to suit novice, intermediate and advanced users "
"alike and has many exercises complete with annotated answers throughout "
"the text."
