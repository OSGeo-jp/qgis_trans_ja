"This guide describes how to use the QGIS processing framework. It assumes"
" no previous knowledge of the Processing framework or any of the "
"applications that it rely on. It assumes basic knowledge of QGIS. The "
"chapters about scripting assume you have some basic knowledge of Python "
"and maybe the QGIS Python API."

"This guide is comprised of a set of small exercises of progressive "
"complexity. If you have never used the processing framework, you should "
"start from the very beginning. If you have some previous experience, feel"
" free to skip lessons. They are more or less independent of each other, "
"and each one introduces some new concept or some new element, as "
"indicated in the chapter title and the short introduction at the "
"beginning of each chapter. That should make it easy to locate lessons "
"dealing with a particular topic."

"All the exercises in this guide use the same free dataset used throughout"
" the training manual and referenced at section :ref:`data_downloadlink`. "
"The zip file to download contains several folders corresponding to each "
"one of the lessons in this guide. In each of them you will find a QGIS "
"project file. Just open it and you will be ready to start the lesson."
