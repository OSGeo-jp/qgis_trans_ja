"In this lesson we will perform some real analysis using just the toolbox,"
" so you can get more familiar with the processing framework elements."

"Now that everything is configured and we can use external algorithms, we "
"have a very powerful tool to perform spatial analysis. It is time to work"
" out a larger exercise with some real--world data."

"We will be using the well-known dataset that John Snow used in 1854, in "
"his groundbreaking work "
"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow_%28physician%29), and we will "
"get some interesting results. The analysis of this dataset is pretty "
"obvious and there is no need for sophisticated GIS techniques to end up "
"with good results and conclusions, but it is a good way of showing how "
"these spatial problems can be analyzed and solved by using different "
"processing tools."

"The dataset contains shapefiles with cholera deaths and pump locations, "
"and an OSM rendered map in TIFF format. Open the corresponding QGIS "
"project for this lesson."

"The first thing to do is to calculate the Voronoi diagram (a.k.a. "
"Thiessen polygons) of the pumps layer, to get the influence zone of each "
"pump. The *Voronoi Diagram* algorithm can be used for that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:22
msgid "Pretty easy, but it will already give us interesting information."

msgid "Clearly, most cases are within one of the polygons"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:28
msgid ""
"To get a more quantitative result, we can count the number of deaths in "
"each polygon. Since each point represents a building where deaths "
"occured, and the number of deaths is stored in an attribute, we cannot "
"just count the points. We need a weighted count, so we will use the "
"*Count points in polygon (weighted)* tool."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:32
msgid ""
"The new field will be called *DEATHS*, and we use the *COUNT* field as "
"weighting field. The resulting table clearly reflects that the number of "
"deaths in the polygon corresponding to the first pump is much larger than"
" the other ones."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:36
msgid ""
"Another good way of visualizing the dependence of each point in the "
"``Cholera_deaths`` layer with a point in the ``Pumps`` layer is to draw a"
" line to the closest one. This can be done with the *Distance to nearest "
"hub* tool, and using the configuration shown next."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:40
msgid "The result looks like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:44
msgid ""
"Although the number of lines is larger in the case of the central pump, "
"do not forget that this does not represent the number of deaths, but the "
"number of locations where cholera cases were found. It is a "
"representative parameter, but it is not considering that some locations "
"might have more cases than other."

"A density layer will also give us a very clear view of what is happening."
" We can create it with the *Kernel density* algorithm. Using the "
"*Cholera_deaths* layer, its *COUNT* field as weight field, with a radius "
"of 100, the extent and cellsize of the streets raster layer, we get "
"something like this."

"Remember that, to get the output extent, you do not have to type it. "
"Click on the button on the right-hand side and select *Use layer/canvas "
"extent*."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Select the streets raster layer and its extent will be automatically "
"added to the text field. You must do the same with the cellsize, "
"selecting the cellsize of that layer as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/john_snow.rst:56
msgid ""
"Combining with the pumps layer, we see that there is one pump clearly in "
"the hotspot where the maximum density of death cases is found."
