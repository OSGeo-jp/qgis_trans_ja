"The first thing to do before using the processing framework is to "
"configure it. There is not much to set-up, so this is an easy task."

msgid ""
"Later on we will show how to configure the external applications that are"
" used for extending the list of available algorithms, but for now we are "
"just going to work with the framework itself."

"The processing framework is a core QGIS plugin, which means that it "
"should already be installed in your system, since it is included with "
"QGIS. In case it is active, you should see a menu called "
":guilabel:`Processing` in your menu bar. There you can access all the "
"framework components."

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:18
msgid ""
"If you cannot find that menu, you have to enable the plugin by going to "
"the plugin manager and activating it."

"The main element that we are going to work with is the toolbox. Click on "
"the corresponding menu entry and you will see the toolbox docked at the "
"right side of the QGIS window."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/set_up.rst:30
msgid ""
"The toolbox contains a list of all the available algorithms, divided in "
"groups called *Providers*. Providers can be (de)activated in the "
":menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Processing`. We will discuss "
"that dialog later in this manual."

msgid ""
"By default, only providers that do not rely on third-party applications "
"(that is, those that only require QGIS elements to be run) are active. "
"Algorithms requiring external applications might need additional "
"configuration. Configuring providers is explained in a later chapter in "
"this manual."

"If you have reached this point, now you are ready to use geoalgorithms. "
"There is no need to configure anything else by now. We can already run "
"our first algorithm, which we will do in the next lesson."
