"In this lesson, we are going to interpolate points data to obtain a "
"raster layer. Before doing it, we will have to do some data preparation, "
"and after interpolating we will add some extra processing to modify the "
"resulting layer, so we will have a complete analysis routine."
msgstr ""

msgid "Open the example data for this lesson, which should look like this."

"The data correspond to crop yield data, as produced by a modern "
"harvester, and we will use it to get a raster layer of crop yield. We do "
"not plan to do any further analysis with that layer, but just to use it "
"as a background layer for easily identifying the most productive areas "
"and also those where productivity can be improved."

"The first thing to do is to clean--up the layer, since it contains "
"redundant points. These are caused by the movement of the harvester, in "
"places where it has to do a turn or it changes its speed for some reason."
" The *Points filter* algorithm will be useful for this. We will use it "
"twice, to remove points that can be considered outliers both in the upper"
" and lower part of the distribution."

"The final filter layer, with a reduced set of points, should look similar"
" to the original one, but it contains a smaller number of points. You can"

"The *Filtered points* layer refers to the resulting one of the second "
"filter. It has the same name as the one produced by the first filter, "
"since the name is assigned by the algorithm, but you should not use the "
"first one. Since we will not be using it for anything else, you can "
"safely remove it from your project to avoid confusion, and leave just the"
" last filtered layer."

"It is already a raster layer, but it is missing data in some of its "
"cells. It only contain valid values in those cells that contained a point"
" from the vector layer that we have just rasterized, and a no--data value"
" in all the other ones. To fill the missing values, we can use the *Close"
" gaps* algorithm."

"To restrict the area covered by the data to just the region where crop "
"yield was measured, we can clip the raster layer with the provided limits"
" layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/interpolation.rst:73

"And for a smoother result (less accurate but better for rendering in the "
"background as a support layer), we can apply a *Gaussian filter* to the "
"layer."
