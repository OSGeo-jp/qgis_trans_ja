"GRASS integration provides access to GRASS GIS databases and "
"functionalities (see GRASS-PROJECT in :ref:`literature_and_web`). The "
"integration consists of two parts: provider and plugin. The provider "
"allows to browse, manage and visualize GRASS raster and vector layers. "
"The plugin can be used to create new GRASS locations and mapsets, change "
"GRASS region, create and edit vector layers and analyze GRASS 2-D and 3-D"
" data with more than 400 GRASS modules. In this section, we'll introduce "
"the provider and plugin functionalities and give some examples of "
"managing and working with GRASS data."
