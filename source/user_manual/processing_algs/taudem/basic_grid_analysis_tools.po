"Calculates a grid of specific catchment area which is the contributing "
"area per unit contour length using the multiple flow direction D-infinity"
" approach. D-infinity flow direction is defined as steepest downward "
"slope on planar triangular facets on a block centered grid. The "
"contribution at each grid cell is taken as the grid cell length (or when "
"the optional weight grid input is used, from the weight grid). The "
"contributing area of each grid cell is then taken as its own contribution"
" plus the contribution from upslope neighbors that have some fraction "
"draining to it according to the D-infinity flow model. The flow from each"
" cell either all drains to one neighbor, if the angle falls along a "
"cardinal (0, π/2, π, 3π/2) or ordinal (π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4) direction, "
"or is on an angle falling between the direct angle to two adjacent "
"neighbors. In the latter case the flow is proportioned between these two "
"neighbor cells according to how close the flow direction angle is to the "
"direct angle to those cells. The contour length used here is the grid "
"cell size. The resulting units of the specific catchment area are length "
"units the same as those of the grid cell size."
