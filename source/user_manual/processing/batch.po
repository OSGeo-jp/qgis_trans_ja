"All algorithms (including models) can be executed as a batch process. "
"That is, they can be executed using not just a single set of inputs, but "
"several of them, executing the algorithm as many times as needed. This is"
" useful when processing large amounts of data, since it is not necessary "
"to launch the algorithm many times from the toolbox."

"To execute an algorithm as a batch process, right-click on its name in "

"Executing a batch process is similar to performing a single execution of "
"an algorithm. Parameter values have to be defined, but in this case we "
"need not just a single value for each parameter, but a set of them "
"instead, one for each time the algorithm has to be executed. Values are "
"introduced using a table like the one shown next."

"Each line of this table represents a single execution of the algorithm, "
"and each cell contains the value of one of the parameters. It is similar "

"Filenames for input data objects are introduced directly typing or, more "
"conveniently, clicking on the :guilabel:`...` button on the right hand of"
" the cell, which will show a context menu with two option: one for "
"selecting from the layers currently opened and another to select from the"
" filesystem. This second option, when selected, shows a typical file "
"chooser dialog. Multiple files can be selected at once. If the input "
"parameter represents a single data object and several files are selected,"
" each one of them will be put in a separate row, adding new ones if "
"needed. If the parameter represents a multiple input, all the selected "
"files will be added to a single cell, separated by semicolons (``;``)."

"Layer identifiers can be directly typed in the parameter text box. You "
"can enter the full path to a file or the name of a layer that is "
"currently loaded in the current QGIS project. The name of the layer will "
"be automatically resolved to its source path. Notice that, if several "
"layers have the same name, this might cause unexpected results due to "
"ambiguity."

"Output data objects are always saved to a file and, unlike when executing"

"If the default value ('Do not autocomplete') is selected, it will just "

" If any of the other options is selected, all the cells below the "
"selected one will be automatically filled based on a defined criteria. "
"This way, it is much easier to fill the table, and the batch process can "
"be defined with less effort."

"Automatic filling can be done by simply adding correlative numbers to the"
" selected file path, or by appending the value of another field at the "
