"For data collection, it is a common situation to work with a laptop or a "
"cell phone offline in the field. Upon returning to the network, the "
"changes need to be synchronized with the master datasource (e.g., a "
"PostGIS database). If several persons are working simultaneously on the "
"same datasets, it is difficult to merge the edits by hand, even if people"
" donâ€™t change the same features."

"The |offlineEditingCopy| :sup:`Offline Editing` Plugin automates the "
"synchronisation by copying the content of a datasource (usually PostGIS "
"or WFS-T) to a SpatiaLite or GeoPackage database and storing the offline "
"edits to dedicated tables. After being connected to the network again, it"
" is possible to apply the offline edits to the master dataset."
