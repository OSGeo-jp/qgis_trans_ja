"The |georefRun|Â Georeferencer is a tool for generating world files for "
"rasters. It allows you to reference rasters to geographic or projected "
"coordinate systems by creating a new GeoTiff or by adding a world file to"
" the existing image. The basic approach to georeferencing a raster is to "
"locate points on the raster for which you can accurately determine "
"coordinates."
