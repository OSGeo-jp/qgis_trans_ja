"Once the master password is entered, the API is open to access "
"authentication configs in the authentication database, similar to how "
"Firefox works. However, in the initial implementation, no wall against "
"PyQGIS access has been defined. This may lead to issues where a user "
"downloads/installs a malicious PyQGIS plugin or standalone app that gains"
" access to authentication credentials."

"The quick solution for initial release of feature is to just not include "
"most PyQGIS bindings for the authentication system."

"Another simple, though not robust, fix is to add a combobox in "
":menuselection:`Settings --> Options --> Authentication` (defaults to "
"\"never\"):"

"Such an option's setting would need to be saved in a location non-"
"accessible to Python, e.g. the authentication database, and encrypted "
"with the master password."

"Sandboxing plugins, possibly in their own virtual environments, would "
"reduce 'cross-plugin' hacking of authentication configs from another "
"plugin that is authorized. This might mean limiting cross-plugin "
"communication as well, but maybe only between third-party plugins."

"Another good solution is to issue code-signing certificates to vetted "
"plugin authors. Then validate the plugin's certificate upon loading. If "
"need be the user can also directly set an untrusted policy for the "
"certificate associated with the plugin using existing certificate "
"management dialogs."

"could never be allowed, and only the use of QGIS core widgets, or "
"duplicating authentication system integrations, would allow the plugin to"
" work with resources that have an authentication configuration, while "
"keeping master password and authentication config loading in the realm of"
" the main app."

"The same security concerns apply to C++ plugins, though it will be harder"

"The confusing `licensing and exporting`_ issues associated with OpenSSL "
"apply. In order for Qt to work with SSL certificates, it needs access to "
"the OpenSSL libraries. Depending upon how Qt was compiled, the default is"
" to dynamically link to the OpenSSL libs at run-time (to avoid the export"
" limitations)."

"QCA follows a similar tactic, whereby linking to QCA incurs no "
"restrictions, because the qca-ossl (OpenSSL) plugin is loaded at run-"
"time. The qca-ossl plugin is directly linked to the OpenSSL libs. "
"Packagers would be the ones needing to ensure any OpenSSL-linking "
"restrictions are met, if they ship the plugin. Maybe.  I don't really "
"know. I'm not a lawyer."
