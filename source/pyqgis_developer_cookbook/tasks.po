"A task (:class:`QgsTask <qgis.core.QgsTask>`) is a container for the code"
" to be performed in the background, and the task manager "
"(:class:`QgsTaskManager <qgis.core.QgsTaskManager>`) is used to control "
"the running of the tasks. These classes simplify background processing in"
" QGIS by providing mechanisms for signaling, progress reporting and "
"access to the status for background processes. Tasks can be grouped using"
" subtasks."

"Any background task (regardless of how it is created) must NEVER use any "
"QObject that lives on the main thread, such as accessing QgsVectorLayer, "
"QgsProject or perform any GUI based operations like creating new widgets "
"or interacting with existing widgets. Qt widgets must only be accessed or"
" modified from the main thread. Data that is used in a task must be "
"copied before the task is started. Attempting to use them from background"
" threads will result in crashes."

"Dependencies between tasks can be described using the :meth:`addSubTask "

"<qgis.core.QgsTask>`. When a dependency is stated, the task manager will "
"automatically determine how these dependencies will be executed. Wherever"
" possible dependencies will be executed in parallel in order to satisfy "
"them as quickly as possible. If a task on which another task depends is "
"canceled, the dependent task will also be canceled. Circular dependencies"
" can make deadlocks possible, so be careful."
