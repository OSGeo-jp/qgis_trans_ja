"This lesson shows how to use pre- and post-execution hooks, which allow "
"to perform additional operations before and after actual processing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:7
msgid ""
"Pre- and post-execution hooks are Processing scripts that run before and "
"after actual data processing is performed. This can be used to automate "
"tasks that should be performed whenever an algorithm is executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:11
msgid ""
"The syntax of the hooks is identical to the syntax of Processing scripts,"
" see the corresponding `chapter "
"<https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/processing/console.html>`_"
" in the QGIS User Guide for more details."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:15
msgid ""
"In addition to all scripts features, in hooks you can use a special "
"global variable named ``alg``, which represents the algorithm that has "
"just been (or is about to be) executed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:19
msgid ""
"Here is an example post-execution script. By default, Processing stores "
"analysis results in temporary files. This script will copy outputs to a "
"specific directory, so they won't be deleted after closing QGIS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:36
msgid ""
"In the first two lines we import the required Python packages: ``os`` ---"
" for path manipulations, e.g. extracting file name, and ``shutil`` --- "
"for various filesystem operations like copying files. In the third line "
"we import Processing outputs. This will be explained in more detail later"
" in this lesson."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:41
msgid ""
"Then we define a ``MY_DIRECTORY`` constant, which is the path to the "
"directory where we want to copy analysis results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:44
msgid ""
"At the end of the script, we have the main hook code. In the loop we "
"iterate over all algorithm outputs and check if this output is a file-"
"based output and can be copied. If so, we determine top-level directory "
"in which output files are located and then copy all files to our "
"directory."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:49
msgid ""
"To activate this hook we need to open the Processing options, find the "
"entry named *Post-execution script file* in the *General* group, and "
"specify the filename of the hook script there. the specified hook will be"
" executed after each Processing algorithm."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:53
msgid ""
"In a similar way, we can implement pre-execution hooks. For example, "
"let's create a hook to check input vectors for geometry errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:69
msgid ""
"As in the previous example, first we import required QGIS and Processing "
"packages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:72
msgid ""
"Then we iterate over all the algorithm parameters and if a "
"ParameterVector parameter is found, we get the corresponding vector layer"
" object from it. We loop over all the features of the layer and check "
"them for geometry errors. If at least one feature contains an invalid "
"geometry, we print a warning message."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/training_manual/processing/hooks.rst:76
msgid ""
"To activate this hook we need enter its filename in the *Pre-execution "
"script file* option in the Processing configuration dialog. The hook will"
" be executed before running any Processing algorithm."
