"QGIS is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project was "
"born in May 2002 and was established as a project on SourceForge in June "
"the same year. We have worked hard to make GIS software (which is "
"traditionally expensive proprietary software) available to anyone with "
"access to a personal computer. QGIS currently runs on most Unix "
"platforms, Windows, and macOS. QGIS is developed using the Qt toolkit "
"(https://www.qt.io) and C++. This means that QGIS feels snappy and has a "
"pleasing, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)."

"QGIS aims to be a user-friendly GIS, providing common functions and "
"features. The initial goal of the project was to provide a GIS data "
"viewer. QGIS has reached the point in its evolution where it is being "
"used for daily GIS data-viewing needs, for data capture, for advanced GIS"
" analysis, and for presentations in the form of sophisticated maps, "
"atlases and reports. QGIS supports a wealth of raster and vector data "
"formats, with new format support easily added using the plugin "
"architecture."
