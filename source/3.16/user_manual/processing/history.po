"Every time you execute an algorithm, information about the process is "
"stored in the history manager. The date and time of the execution are "
"saved, along with the parameters used, making it is easy to track and "
"control all the work that has been developed using the Processing "
"framework, and to reproduce it."

"Process information is kept as a command-line expression, even if the "
"algorithm was launched from the toolbox. This makes it useful for those "
"learning how to use the command-line interface, since they can call an "
"algorithm using the toolbox and then check the history manager to see how"
" it could be called from the command line."

"Apart from browsing the entries in the registry, you can also re-execute "
"processes by simply double-clicking on the entry. The algorithm dialog "
"then opens with parameters already set, and you can change any of them to"
" fit your needs and re-run the algorithm."

"The :guilabel:`History` dialog also provides a convenient way to "
"contribute to the consolidation of the testing infrastructure of QGIS "
"Processing algorithms and scripts. When you right-click on an entry, you "
"can :guilabel:`Create Test...` using the concerned algorithm and "
"parameters, following instructions at "
":source:`python/plugins/processing/tests/README.md`."

"The history dialog only contains the execution calls, but not the "
"information produced by the algorithm when executed. That information is "

"Third-party algorithms are usually executed by using their command-line "
"interfaces, which communicate with the user via the console. Although "
"that console is not shown, usually a full dump of it is written to the "
"log each time you run one of those algorithms. To avoid cluttering the "
"log with that information, you can disable it for each provider in the "
"settings dialog."

"Some algorithms, even if they can produce a result with the given input "
"data, output comments or additional information to log when they detect "
"potential problems with the data, in order to warn you. Make sure you "
"check those messages in the log if you get unexpected results."
