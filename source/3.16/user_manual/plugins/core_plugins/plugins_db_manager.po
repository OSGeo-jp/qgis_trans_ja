"The DB Manager Plugin is intended to be the main tool to integrate and "
"manage spatial database formats supported by QGIS (PostGIS, SpatiaLite, "
"GeoPackage, Oracle Spatial, Virtual layers) in one user interface. The "
"|dbManager| :sup:`DB Manager` Plugin provides several features. You can "
"drag layers from the QGIS Browser into the DB Manager, and it will import"
" your layer into your spatial database. You can drag and drop tables "
"between spatial databases and they will get imported."

"The :menuselection:`Database` menu allows you to connect to an existing "

"PostgreSQL) and :menuselection:`Table` will appear."

"The :menuselection:`Table` menu allows you to create and edit tables and "
"to delete tables and views. It is also possible to empty tables and to "
"move tables between schemas. You can :guilabel:`Run Vacuum Analyze` for "
"the selected table. *Vacuum* reclaims space and makes it available for "
"reuse, and *analyze* updates statistics that is used to determine the "
"most efficient way to execute a query. :guilabel:`Change Logging...` "
"allows you to add change logging support to a table. Finally, you can "
":guilabel:`Import Layer/File...` and :guilabel:`Export to File...`."

"If connected to a database, the **main** window of the DB Manager offers "

":guilabel:`Column(s) with unique values` (IDs), :guilabel:`Geometry "
