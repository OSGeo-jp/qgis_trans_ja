"A Coordinate Reference System, or CRS, is a method of associating "
"numerical coordinates with a position on the surface of the Earth. QGIS "
"has support for approximately 7,000 standard CRSs, each with different "
"use cases, pros and cons! Choosing an appropriate reference system for "
"your QGIS projects and data can be a complex task, but fortunately QGIS "
"helps guide you through this choice, and makes working with different "
"CRSs as transparent and accurate as possible."

"QGIS has support for approximately 7,000 known CRSs. These standard CRSs "
"are based on those defined by the European Petroleum Search Group (EPSG) "
"and the Institut Geographique National de France (IGNF), and are made "
"available in QGIS through the underlying \"Proj\" projection library. "
"Commonly, these standard projections are identified through use of an "
"authority:code combination, where the authority is an organisation name "
"such as \"EPSG\" or \"IGNF\", and the code is a unique number associated "
"with a specific CRS. For instance, the common WGS 84 latitude/longitude "
"CRS is known by the identifier ``EPSG:4326``, and the web mapping "
"standard CRS is ``EPSG:3857``."

"In order to correctly project data into a specific target CRS, either "
"your data must contain information about its coordinate reference system "
"or you will need to manually assign the correct CRS to the layer. For "
"PostGIS layers, QGIS uses the spatial reference identifier that was "
"specified when that PostGIS layer was created. For data supported by OGR "
"or GDAL, QGIS relies on the presence of a recognized means of specifying "
"the CRS. For instance, for the Shapefile format this is a file containing"
" an ESRI Well-Known Text (:index:`WKT`) representation of the layer's "
"CRS. This projection file has the same base name as the :file:`.shp` file"
" and a :file:`.prj` extension. For example, :file:`alaska.shp` would have"
