"You can overlay watermarks over the maps produced by your WMS by adding "
"text annotations or SVG annotations to the project file. See the "
":ref:`sec_annotations` section for instructions on creating annotations. "
"For annotations to be displayed as watermarks on the WMS output, the "
":guilabel:`Fixed map position` checkbox in the :guilabel:`Annotation "
"text` dialog must be unchecked. This can be accessed by double clicking "
"the annotation while one of the annotation tools is active. For SVG "
"annotations, you will need either to set the project to save absolute "
"paths (in the :guilabel:`General` menu of the :menuselection:`Project -->"
" Properties...` dialog) or to manually modify the path to the SVG image "
"so that it represents a valid relative path."
