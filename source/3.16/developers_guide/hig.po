"Group related elements using group boxes: Try to identify elements that "
"can be grouped together and then use group boxes with a label to identify"
" the topic of that group. Avoid using group boxes with only a single "
"widget / item inside."

"Capitalise first letter only in labels, tool tips, descriptive text, and "
"other non-heading or title text: These should be written as a phrase with"
" leading capital letter, and all remaining words written with lower case "
"first letters, unless they are nouns"

"Capitalize all words in Titles (group box, tab, list view columns, and so"
" on), Functions (menu items, buttons), and other selectable items "
"(combobox items, listbox items, tree list items, and so on): Capitalize "
"all words, except prepositions that are shorter than five letters (for "
"example, 'with' but 'Without'), conjunctions (for example, and, or, but),"
" and articles (a, an, the). However, always capitalize the first and last"
" word."

"Do not end labels for widgets or group boxes with a colon: Adding a colon"
" causes visual noise and does not impart additional meaning, so don't use"
" them. An exception to this rule is when you have two labels next to each"
" other e.g.: Label1 Plugin (Path:) Label2 [/path/to/plugins]"

"Always use a QButtonBox for 'OK', 'Cancel' etc buttons: Using a button "

" separate tab."
