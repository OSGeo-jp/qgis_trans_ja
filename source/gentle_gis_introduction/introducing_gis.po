"You can see an example of what a **GIS Application** looks like "

"keyboard. The application provides **menus** near to the top of the "
"window (File, Edit etc.) which, when clicked using the mouse, show a "
"panel of **actions**. These actions provide a way for you to tell the GIS"

"Another common feature of GIS Applications is the **map legend**. The map"

"layers. Changing the layer order is done by clicking on a layer in the "
"legend, holding the mouse button down and then dragging the layer to a "

"example, our health care worker could store the person's age and gender "
"on her table. When the GIS Application draws the layer, you can tell it "
"to draw the layer based on gender, or based on disease type, and so on. "
